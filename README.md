## What's ScriptServer?
A configurable Minecraft server wrapper written in Node.js.
Using a combination of RCON and the output of the server console it allows you to do some pretty cool things.
Though, this is the engine of ScriptServer, and is honestly pretty bare.
The modules are where the magic happens (check 'Published Modules' down below).

## Notice
Scriptserver is currently undergoing a complete rewrite, follow the `next` branch to keep up with changes, this will soon be published as `2.0.0`
